## 4. Description

### 🔍 Cat & Dog Image Classifier
A CNN-based model trained on a dataset of labeled cat and dog images. Data augmentation techniques are used to prevent overfitting, and the model is deployed via a simple Gradio UI for interactive testing.

### 🗣️ IMDB Sentiment Analysis
The NLP pipeline uses word embeddings and recurrent models (like LSTMs) to process movie reviews. The output is a binary sentiment classification — Positive or Negative — and is visualized using a real-time demo.

### 🏥 Healthcare Billing Predictor
This project uses structured demographic and lifestyle data to predict insurance costs. Regression models are evaluated using MSE and R². Feature importance and residual plots are used to interpret the results.

| Project                       | Accuracy / R² Score | Output Example                         |
|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Cat & Dog Classifier         | ~90%                | "Prediction: Cat"                    |
| IMDB Sentiment Analysis      | ~85%                | "Sentiment: Positive"                |
| Healthcare Billing Predictor | ~0.82 R²            | "Predicted cost: $14,562.30"         |
