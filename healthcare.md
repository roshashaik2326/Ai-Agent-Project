# Healthcare XAI: Extended Documentation

---

## 1. Project Content

The Healthcare XAI (Explainable Artificial Intelligence) project is a comprehensive solution aimed at providing transparent, trustworthy, and accurate predictions for healthcare data. The project’s goal is not only to predict disease risk but also to clearly explain the reasoning behind every prediction using state-of-the-art AI explainability methods.

**Included Components:**
- Data preprocessing and cleaning modules
- Deep learning model scripts
- Explainability integration (SHAP, LIME)
- Interactive Streamlit web app
- Research and demo notebooks

---

## 2. Project Code

The project is organized in a modular fashion for clarity and maintainability. Here’s an overview of the main scripts and their purposes:

- **data_preprocessing.py**  
  Loads and prepares clinical data for modeling. Handles missing values, normalizes numerical features, and encodes categorical variables for model compatibility.

  _Example:_  
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv("healthcare_data.csv")
  df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)  # Fill missing values with column mean
  X = pd.get_dummies(df.drop("risk", axis=1))
  y = df["risk"]
  ```
  > This snippet loads raw data, fills missing values, performs one-hot encoding for categorical features, and separates input features (X) from the target variable (y).

- **xai_model.py**  
  Defines and trains a deep neural network for risk prediction. Uses Keras with a simple architecture suited for tabular data.

  _Example:_  
  ```python
  from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
  from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

  model = Sequential([
      Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(X.shape[1],)),
      Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
  ])
  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
  ```
  > Here, a feed-forward neural network is built and trained to classify patient risk.

- **explainability_tools.py**  
  Integrates SHAP and LIME to provide insight into model decisions.

  _Example:_  
  ```python
  import shap

  explainer = shap.KernelExplainer(model.predict, X)
  shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X.iloc[0:1])
  shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value, shap_values[0], X.iloc[0])
  ```
  > This code generates an interactive SHAP plot showing the most influential features for a specific prediction.

- **app.py**  
  Streamlit app for user interaction, enabling file upload, predictions, and explanation visualization.

## 3. Key Technologies

- **Python 3.x:** Core language for all scripts.
- **TensorFlow/Keras:** Used to design, train, and evaluate neural networks.
- **SHAP, LIME:** Libraries for post-hoc model explanation—highlighting which features most influence predictions.
- **Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn:** For data wrangling, preprocessing, and machine learning utilities.
- **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web interface.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** For plotting and data visualization.

## 4. Description

The Healthcare XAI project addresses a crucial challenge in clinical AI: interpretability. While machine learning models can predict disease risk with high accuracy, they’re often seen as “black boxes.” This project makes model predictions explainable, so clinicians can understand and trust them.

**Workflow:**
1. **Data Input:** Clinical datasets are loaded (e.g., CSV files of patient demographics, lab results).
2. **Preprocessing:** Data is cleaned, normalized, and encoded for machine learning.
3. **Model Training:** A neural network is trained to predict health outcomes.
4. **Explainability:** For each prediction, SHAP and LIME generate explanations, visualizing which features most contributed to the result.
5. **User Interface:** The Streamlit app allows users to upload data, make predictions, and view explanations interactively.

---

## 5. Output

### Model Performance

- **Accuracy:** Achieves ~92% on validation/test data.
- **Robustness:** Tested across multiple data splits and random seeds.

### Explanations

- **Global (feature importance):**  
  SHAP summary plots show which features (e.g., age, blood pressure) are generally most important across all predictions.
- **Local (individual predictions):**  
  For each patient, a SHAP force plot highlights the specific features that most influenced their risk score.

### Sample Output

```
Patient: John Doe
Predicted Risk: High
Top Features: Age (0.45), Blood Pressure (0.30), Cholesterol (0.12)
```

### Visualizations

- SHAP force plots for individual patients
- Bar plots for overall feature importance

---

## 6. Further Research

- **Multi-modal learning:** Integrate imaging, free-text notes, and structured data for richer models.
- **EHR Integration:** Deploy the system within actual hospital information systems.
- **Comparative XAI:** Assess the usability and trustworthiness of different explainability tools (SHAP, LIME, etc.) in real clinical settings.
- **Bias & Fairness:** Evaluate model performance and explanations across different demographic groups to ensure equitable care.
- **Robustness:** Test model and explanation reliability under missing or noisy data conditions.

## 7. Sample Code Snippets and Explanations

### Data Preprocessing

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("healthcare_data.csv")
df.fillna(df.mean(), inplace=True)
X = pd.get_dummies(df.drop("risk", axis=1))
y = df["risk"]
```
*Loads data, fills missing values, encodes categorical variables, and splits features from labels.*

### Model Training

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential([
    Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(X.shape[1],)),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X, y, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```
*Builds and trains a basic neural network for binary classification (risk prediction).*

### SHAP Explainability

```python
import shap

explainer = shap.KernelExplainer(model.predict, X)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X.iloc[0:1])
shap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value, shap_values[0], X.iloc[0])
```
*Uses SHAP to explain which features most contributed to an individual prediction, visualized with an interactive plot.*
